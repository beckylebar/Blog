Learning about computers
```
A couple of weeks ago, I started taking a self-guided introductory computer science course with [MIT Open Courseware](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00sc-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-spring-2011/).  This is the intro to intro class, because the intro class is really just too difficult for most MIT freshman.  My first impressions were that the course materials were very well organized and very well curated.  I started by clicking through the recommended references.  

######Binary Fingers versus the US public education system

My initial clicking landed me on a page about learning to count in binary using your fingers.  I am primarily a kinesthetic learner, so this exercise was fun: [Count to 1000 on your fingers](http://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/binary-count-fingers.html).  However, the real take-away for me was anger and dread,

>Why did I only ever learn base-10?!

Increasingly, technical protocols are obscured from users who lack basic technical literacy.  I include myself in this bucket.  I've learned to rely on Graphical User Interfaces to interpret computers, protocols, services, etc.  It is convenient to trust blindly and consume services freely, but in exchange I have surrendered a great deal of agency and creativity.  Including basic technical literacy in the [Common Core Standards](http://www.corestandards.org/) would be a good start, but imho we should go a step further and include curriculum and standards for *critical thinking* about technology.
